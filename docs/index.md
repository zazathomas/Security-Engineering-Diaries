# Welcome to The Security Engineering Diaries!

Hello! I'm a **Security Engineer** with over six years of experience, passionate about **cybersecurity**, **virtualization**, **Kubernetes**, **homelabbing**, and **gaming**. I’ve created this site to document my journey as I continually learn, experiment, and upskill in the world of cybersecurity and technology.

## What You’ll Find Here

This site serves as a repository for my thoughts, experiments, and insights on various topics within the tech landscape. My goal is to share my experiences to help others who might be on similar paths and provide practical insights for those looking to improve their skills in security, infrastructure, and beyond.

### Blog Posts
I write blog posts that cover:
- **Cybersecurity Training & Certification**: Tips, challenges, and resources for upskilling in cybersecurity leveraging lessons learned from hands-on practice and simulations.
- **Home Lab Projects**: Step-by-step guides on building and optimizing a homelab environment, from deploying VMs and containers to configuring secure network architectures.
- **Tool Deployments**: Walkthroughs for setting up various security and productivity tools (SIEMs, K8s native security tools, IDS/IPS systems, monitoring tools, etc.) in a homelab setting.
- **Kubernetes & Virtualization**: Tutorials on deploying Kubernetes clusters securely and using virtualization platforms effectively in personal projects.
- **Gaming & Tech for Fun**: Occasionally, I'll share insights on gaming setups, game server hosting, and how I use tech for entertainment and creativity.

### Why Homelabbing?
Homelabbing isn't just a hobby for me—it's a way to test new technologies in a hands-on, low-risk environment. Running my own lab has enabled me to:
- Experiment with **cutting-edge cybersecurity tools** and practices.

- Gain practical skills in **Kubernetes**, **containerization**, and **cloud-native environments**.

- Deepen my understanding of **network security** and **infrastructure management**.

- Host various utility tools that simplify every day tasks(shoutout [r/selfhosted](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/)).

- Build a customized setup that merges work and play.

### Areas of Focus
1. **Cybersecurity**: A constant priority, with a focus on threat detection, response strategies, and staying updated with the latest attack vectors.
2. **Automation**: Automating deployments and security processes to improve efficiency and reduce repetitive tasks.
3. **Virtualization & Kubernetes**: Leveraging virtualization for flexible lab setups, and exploring Kubernetes as a powerful tool for scalable and resilient application deployment.
4. **Upskilling and Certifications**: Sharing my journey through ongoing training, from courses to certifications, in the evolving field of security.

## Join Me on This Journey!
