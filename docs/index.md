This site serves as a repository for my thoughts, experiments, and insights on various topics within the tech landscape. My goal is to share my experiences to help others who might be on similar paths and provide practical insights for those looking to improve their skills in security, infrastructure, and beyond.


I write blog posts that cover:

- **Security tooling Deployments**: Walkthroughs for setting up various security, observability and productivity tools (SIEMs, K8s native security tools, IDS/IPS systems, monitoring tools, etc.) used in enterprise environments.
- **Kubernetes & Virtualization**: Tutorials on deploying Kubernetes clusters securely and using virtualization platforms effectively in personal projects.
- **Home Lab Projects**: Step-by-step guides on building and optimizing a homelab environment, from infrastructure provisioning to configuring secure network architectures and everything else inbetween.
- **Cybersecurity Training & Certification**: Tips, challenges, and resources for upskilling in cybersecurity leveraging lessons learned from hands-on practice and simulations.
- **Gaming & Tech for Fun**: Occasionally, I'll share insights on gaming setups, game server hosting, and how I use tech for entertainment and creativity.

## Why Build out a homelab?
Homelabbing isn't just a hobby for me—it's a way to test new technologies in a hands-on, low-risk environment. Running my own lab has enabled me to:

- Experiment with **cutting-edge cybersecurity tools** and practices.

- Gain practical skills in **Kubernetes**, **containerization**, and **cloud-native environments**.

- Deepen my understanding of **network security** and **infrastructure management**.

- Host various utility tools that simplify every day tasks(shoutout [r/selfhosted](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/)).

- Build a customized setup that merges work and play in a fun and engaging manner.
